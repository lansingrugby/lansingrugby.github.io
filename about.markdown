    <p>The Capital Area Crisis is a team founded and comprised of MSU alumni, local athletes, and local sportsmen. Founded in 2013, Crisis already has a solid foundation of players with years of experience and has already established a winning tradition. The club’s mission is to build rugby in Lansing and give back to the Lansing community, which has been demonstrated in the club’s affiliation and support both for and from other Lansing clubs and the Lansing department of recreation. Lansing Crisis is a USA Rugby affiliated club with prominence in Michigan and the Midwest.</p>
    <p>In 2014 The Crisis organized and competed in it's first rugby tournament, hosting Tri-City Barbarians, Flint Roges, Oakland University, Saginaw Valley and MSU in Lansing.</p>
